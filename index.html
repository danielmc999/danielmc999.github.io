<h2>About</h2>
 <p class="p2"><span>
 I am an Associate Professor of Marketing at the University of Maryland's Robert H. Smith School of Business. I popularized customer-based corporate valuation, a "bottom-up" approach to valuing firms by assessing the value of their customers. My other areas of research include data fusion, data privacy, missing data problems, machine learning, and causal inference.

 <br /> <br />
 My research has been accepted and published in top-tier academic journals such as the Journal of Marketing Research, Marketing Science, Journal of Marketing, Journal of the American Statistical Association: Theory and Methods, and Annals of Applied Statistics. My work has also been featured in media outlets such as the Harvard Business Review, Wall Street Journal, FT, Fortune, The Economist, Inc, USA Today, Barron's, CBS, CNBC, Slate, Business Insider, and CFO Magazine. I have won numerous awards, including the Don Lehmann Award, Robert J. Lavidge Award, MSI Alden G. Clayton Award, ISMS Award, Shankar-Spiegel Award, and Gary Lilien ISMS-MSI-EMAC Practice Prize. I was also a finalist for many others, including the Paul Green, John A. Howard/AMA, JM Hunt/Maynard, and MSI H. Paul Root Awards.
 <br /> <br />
 
 In 2015, I co-founded a predictive analytics company, Zodiac, where I served as the Chief Statistician. Zodiac was acquired by Nike in March 2018. I subsequently co-founded Theta to commercialize my work on customer-based corporate valuation.

 <br /> <br />

 Before joining the University of Maryland, I was an Assistant Professor of Marketing at Emory University's Goizueta School of Business. I hold a Ph.D. in Statistics from The Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. I also earned a BSc in Economics with a concentration in Statistics and Finance from The Wharton School and a BAS in Systems Science Engineering from the School of Engineering and Applied Science, as part of the Jerome Fisher Program in Management and Technology at the University of Pennsylvania.
